           I am a researcher focussed on medical applications of machine learning. My interests revolve around temporal models for disease and intervention prediction. This interest motivated my participation in the Physionet 2019 challenge in which my team finished 5th internationally. More recently, I have been working on translating research in metagenomics to multiplexed PCR assays of human circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in order to reduce measurement noise. 

           In my spare time, I mentor students from my alma mater, guiding them through research topics encompassing various machine learning domains.

            Online learning platforms also known as Computer Aided Education Systems have recently grown in importance owing to their ability to personalize study plans in accordance with individual student requirements. Learning platforms have modeled student knowledge state using student responses with the recently popular Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) technique. Using context information has also proven effective in various predictive problems prompting learning platforms to store a variety of context features about a student‚Äôs performance history. An example context may be response time, where shorter times to answer questions may indicate higher mastery of a skill. Therefore, it is crucial to incorporate context features in the most effective way possible. Most of the research in DKT either use no context features, or use a set of context features that span only a narrow set of student characteristics. To overcome this, we identify a wide set of context features and incorporate their interactions into the DKT model. We then observe the effects of incorporating these additional context feature interactions and also propose an adaptive weighting technique that learns the appropriate context feature interaction weights. These techniques are compared with state-of-the-art baselines and their performances were evaluated using AUC scores.

            The linear submodular bandit problem was proposed to simultaneously address diversified retrieval and online learning in a recommender system. If there is no uncertainty, this problem is equivalent to a submodular maximization problem under a cardinality constraint. However, in some situations, recommendation lists should satisfy additional constraints such as budget constraints, other than a cardinality constraint. Thus, motivated by diversified retrieval considering budget constraints, we introduce a submodular bandit problem under the intersection of ùëô knapsacks and a ùëò-system constraint. Here ùëò-system constraints form a very general class of constraints including cardinality constraints and the intersection of ùëò matroid constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a non-greedy algorithm that adaptively focuses on a standard or modified upper-confidence bound. We provide a high-probability upper bound of an approximation regret, where the approximation ratio matches that of a fast offline algorithm. Moreover, we perform experiments under various combinations of constraints using asynthetic and two real-world datasets and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the existing baselines.

            Increasing users‚Äô positive interactions, such as purchases or clicks, is an important objective of recommender systems. Recommenders typically aim to select items that users will interact with. If the recommended items are purchased, an increase in sales is expected. However, the items could have been purchased even without recommendation. Thus, we want to recommend items that results in purchases caused by recommendation. This can be formulated as a ranking problem in terms of the causal effect. Despite its importance, this problem has not been well explored in the related research. It is challenging because the ground truth of causal effect is unobservable, and estimating the causal effect is prone to the bias arising from currently deployed recommenders. This paper proposes an unbiased learning framework for the causal effect of recommendation. Based on the inverse propensity scoring technique, the proposed framework first constructs unbiased estimators for ranking metrics. Then, it conducts empirical risk minimization on the estimators with propensity capping, which reduces variance under finite training samples. Based on the framework, we develop an unbiased learning method for the causal effect extension of a ranking metric. We theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed method and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other biased learning methods in various settings.

            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is rapidly spreading across the globe. The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases, with a large spectrum of symptoms. The fear of contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to continuously monitor non-severe COVID-19 patients, either from their quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g. hotels). In particular, facilitating contact tracing with proximity and location tracing apps was adopted in many countries very rapidly. Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively monitor patient health status. In this paper, we present a review of remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 20 states during the time of the pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.

            <u>Aims:</u> Physicians have to routinely make crucial decisions about patients‚Äô health in the ICU. Sepsis affects about 35% of ICU patients, killing approximately 25% of the afflicted. In this paper, we aim to predict the occurrence of sepsis early by studying the missingness of physiological variables and using it with the overall trends in data.
            <br>
            <u>Methods:</u> We chose XGBoost as our base model and tried several variations by changing hyperparameters, window sizes and imputation methods. To further improve the model, we used masking vectors to represent the missingness of features in the dataset. Additional modifications include shifting the Sepsis Label to earlier time steps and tuning the classification probability threshold to further improve the model‚Äôs performance.
            <br>
            <u>Results:</u> The XGBoost model with a sliding window of size 5, no imputation, utilizing informative missingness of all temporal variables and trained on labels shifted by 3 hours before t<sub>optimal</sub>, achieved a Utility Score of 0.337 on the full test set. We identified as ‚ÄùCTL-Team‚Äù in the challenge and were officially ranked 5th on the basis of this score.

            Recommender systems aim to increase user actions such as clicks and purchases. Typical evaluations of recommenders regard the purchase of a recommended item as a success. However, the item may have been purchased even without the recommendation. An uplift is defined as an increase in user actions caused by recommendations. Situations with and without a recommendation cannot both be observed for a specific user-item pair at a given time instance, making uplift-based evaluation and optimization challenging. This paper proposes new evaluation metrics and optimization methods for the uplift in a recommender system. We apply a causal inference framework to estimate the average uplift for the offline evaluation of recommenders. Our evaluation protocol leverages both purchase and recommendation logs under a currently deployed recommender system, to simulate the cases both with and without recommendations. This enables the offline evaluation of the uplift for newly generated recommendation lists. For optimization, we need to define positive and negative samples that are specific to an uplift-based approach. For this purpose, we deduce four classes of items by observing purchase and recommendation logs. We derive the relative priorities among these four classes in terms of the uplift and use them to construct both pointwise and pairwise sampling methods for uplift optimization. Through dedicated experiments with three public datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization methods in improving the uplift.
