Janmajay Singh's blog.

The structure has been heavily borrowed from [Samuel Finlayson's](https://sgfin.github.io/) extremely informative blog which in turn had leveraged code from Andrew Miller, Sam Greydanus, and Andrej Karpathy.

The theme used was [Tufte Jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll).
